From icomoon.io. I've picked the Font-Awesome glyphs I used and put them in their own web font – saves loading 200kb+ of Font Awesome icons that I don't use.

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu → Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.
